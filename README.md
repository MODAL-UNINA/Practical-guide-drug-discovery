# Practical and Reproducible AI-driven Modeling Protocols in Drug Discovery

This repository contains files associated with the chapter **"Practical and Reproducible AI-driven Modeling Protocols in Drug Discovery."** The materials provided here are intended to support reproducibility and practical implementation of AI techniques in drug discovery.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Preprocessing Script:**  
  The script responsible for cleaning, filtering, and preparing the raw data for further analysis. This script outlines the necessary steps to process the original dataset into a format suitable for AI-driven modeling.

- **Preprocessed Dataset:**  
  The dataset resulting from the data preprocessing pipeline. This file contains the curated and processed data used for developing and evaluating predictive models in drug discovery.

## Original Dataset

The data provided in this repository is based on the Papyrus dataset:

> BÃ©quignon, O.J.M., Bongers, B.J., Jespers, W. et al. Papyrus: a large-scale curated dataset aimed at bioactivity predictions. *Journal of Cheminformatics*, **15**, 3 (2023).
